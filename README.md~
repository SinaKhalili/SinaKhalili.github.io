# SinaKhalili.github.io

This is my personnal website! 

For the scroll animations I used scrollmagic and GSAP.

Things that I should definitely still add: 
  [] Better code styling (adding more relevant comments, removing redundant/benign code)
  [] Contact form
  [] Actually showcasing projects instead of linking to github
  [x] Uploading a real resume instead of linking to linkedin
