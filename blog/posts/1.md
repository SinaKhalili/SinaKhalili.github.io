# Welcome to the month, welcome to the blog

This is a monumentous month, let's not waste it friends.

It the time to do the following

- Controlled irrationality
- Beginning new creative endeavors
- Working hard

It is *not* the time for

- Being safe
- Reasonability
- Sloth

This blog here will be updated daily with notes on code and observations.

Currently being powered by [heckle](https://github.com/2016rshah/heckle)
because I thought it looked like a cool project on github.

Anyways, hold on to your butts because if my sense is correct this is going to
be a productive month.
