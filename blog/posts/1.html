<p>This is a monumentous month, let's not waste it friends.</p>
<p>It the time to do the following</p>
<ul>
<li>Controlled irrationality</li>
<li>Beginning new creative endeavors</li>
<li>Working hard</li>
</ul>
<p>It is <em>not</em> the time for</p>
<ul>
<li>Being safe</li>
<li>Reasonability</li>
<li>Sloth</li>
</ul>
<p>This blog here will be updated daily with notes on code and observations.</p>
<p>Currently being powered by <a href="https://github.com/2016rshah/heckle">heckle</a> because I thought it looked like a cool project on github.</p>
<p>Anyways, hold on to your butts because if my sense is correct this is going to be a productive month.</p></div>
