# Some ideas on speeds of time

Time moves at different speeds dependent on context. 

Divide this time into two ways:

- Look-forwards time
- Look-back time

Something that has large look-forwards time means it feels like it's taking significantly longer than it truly is. I will call a strong look-forwards time as intense. Weak look-forwards time will be called benign. 

Something that has large look-back time gives the impression of that action having happened much longer ago. Strong look-back time will be called memorable - weak will be called immemorable. 

With this we can categorize the time 
x         |intense | benign 
__________|________|______|
memorable | great pain| serendipity
immemorable|repeated pleasure | routine
